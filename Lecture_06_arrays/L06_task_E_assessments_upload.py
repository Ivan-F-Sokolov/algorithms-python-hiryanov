"""
Like in the previous task, there is two tasks in one. I guess it's a mistake
of the course author, because there is no information about this in the task
description on the site. Let's name these two tasks "Option A" and "Option B".
The official course description on the site is only about the "Option A".
But online tests also need the "Option B". Regardless of it, the problem is
solvable. For completing the tests, first of all, checks the first input line.
If it is a big number, greater then a 1000, there is an "Option B".
Else "Option A". The description for the options will follow below.

This task is working with huge data from input.
There is no test for it. Only contest online-test.
"""


# Sets an "Option A" variable to "True" by default.
option_A = True

# Catches a first line.
first_line = int(input())

# Checks the first line.
# If it's greater then a 1000, an "Option B" is on.
if first_line > 1000:

    # Sets the "option A" variable to "False". It will be used by
    # the main "if" term for picking the right part of the code.

"""
Option A:
There are the assessments of the students. It is known, how many students are.
An amount of the assessments may vary. Find a sum of the assessments for each
student. Sort students by the sum of their assessments in reverse order. Then,
sort the assessments of each student in reverse order. Sums are not needed
to be printed. Print out only assessments as it's sorted. First, by the sum
of one student in reverse order. Second, by the assessments themselves
in reverse order.

Input format:
The first line is an amount of the students. Then, on each line there is
a student ID and one assessment separated by an empty space. Students may have
a different amount of the assessments. Some students may have no assessments
at all. "#" means the end.

Output format:
One string of numbers with an empty space between them. The numbers are
the assessments of the students, sorted by two terms. The main term is
the assessments' sum of one student in reverse order. The second term is
the assessments themselves in reverse order. There is no special separation
among different students' assessments. The hole string is only numbers with
an empty space between them. For example, just after the assessments
of the best student are ended, the assessments of the second best student
are started with only an empty space between them.

An example of input:
3
2 4
2 2
0 10
2 3
0 3
