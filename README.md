>Features:
- Visual explanations as .png images for some tasks.
- Detailed commentary (including the description of the task).
- Tests for most of the answers.

>Some explanations:

Most of the answers are written as one whole function.  
You can put them in another file as module.  
Tests use answers as modules (via import).  
Tests is printing results when running.

Though, first answers from the first lecture aren't written as functions at all.  
It's been made for the better understanding by novices.  
A bit later in the first lecture, the functions are introduced.  
Though this functions are still parts of the whole task code.  
Also all tasks in the first lecture (except first one) are visual.  
Anyway you need to run the code to see the result.  
So there is no tests for the first lecture's code.  
Some other tasks in the course are visual also and don't have tests as well.

Sometimes files from different lectures are opened at the same time.  
Names of files starts from the number of the lecture, e.g. "L01".  
It's been made for the better navigate purpose.

Files with upload-suffix have been written to send it in the course-testing site.  
This files contains additional code below the main.  
This code is able to get some input data and give some output data (via print).  
Using a good editor (like the PyCharm), you can collapse a whole function in one line.  
It's much easier to read additional code this way.
