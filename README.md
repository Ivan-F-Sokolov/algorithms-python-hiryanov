### **ATTENTION !!!**

### This is a scratch with a dirty brutal force code.

### I truly regret that I didn't write clean code from the start.

### This version of repository exists for a historical purpose.

### Also it may be useful untill the main version is behind.

_(Actually in this version I already have started to rewrite the code.  
I did rewriting up to lecture 06 and then I take some pause starting  
to study different things like GIT and command line. Going back to  
this course I realize I did too many unnecessary comments in the  
new rewritten code. So I start to rewrite again. And not just  
removing foolish comments, but also working on readability. Also  
I'v learned GIT pretty well. So I put all my previous work in a  
separate unconnected tag. This is where you are right now, if you  
see this text. You can look at some code here and make fun of me.  
I continue to work on rewriting and making new lectures at public  
branches of this repository.)_

Here is an old readme below (so many unnecessary things):

> Features:

- Visual explanations as .png images for some tasks.
- Detailed commentary (including the description of the task).
- Tests for most of the answers.

> Some explanations:

Online contest tasks was made for 737 and 738 groups of the course.  
This is only available option for remote learning.

Don't worry about additional files or directories like "pyrob" or "graphics.py".  
These are the modules required for the answers' code.

Most of the answers are written as one whole function.  
You can put them in another file as module.  
Tests use answers as modules (via import).  
Tests is printing results when running.

Though, first answers from the first lecture aren't written as functions at all.  
It's been made for the better understanding by novices.  
A bit later in the first lecture, the functions are introduced.  
Though this functions are still parts of the whole task code.  
Also all tasks in the first lecture (except first one) are visual.  
Anyway you need to run the code to see the result.  
So there is no tests for the first lecture's code.  
Some other tasks in the course are visual also and don't have tests as well.

Also some tasks are working with huge data from input.  
There is no tests for them too. Only contest online-test.

Sometimes files from different lectures are opened at the same time.  
Names of the files starts from the number of the lecture, e.g. "L01".  
It's been made for the better navigate purpose.

_The files' managment is changing.  
The information below still works for some files.  
Though I'm merging files with and without "upload" suffix.  
In the near future, there will not be "upload" files anymore.  
All files will be able to upload and to be tested as well.  
If there is no "upload" or "upload_only" files,  
then the main file is ready to be uploaded itself._

Files with "upload" suffix have been written to send it in the course-testing site.  
This files contains additional code below the main.  
This code is able to get some input data and give some output data (via print).  
Using a good editor (like the PyCharm), you can collapse a whole function in one line.  
It's much easier to read additional code this way.

There is no standalone modules for the files with "upload_only" suffix.  
There is no tests for those answers (contest online-test only).  
It is because those tasks is limited by memory and use big input data.
