The site with [all tasks](http://judge.mipt.ru/mipt_cs_on_python3/).

>Features:
- Tests for most of the answers.
- Every answer from contest has a separated file with additional code for the upload purpose.
- Every answer has a detailed description of the task (as a comment inside the code).

>Some explanations:

Most of the answers are written as functions.  
You can put them in another file as module.  
Tests use answers as modules (via import).  
Tests is printing results when running.

Though, first answers from the first lecture aren't written as functions.  
It's been made for the better understanding by novices.  
Also all tasks in the first lecture (except first one) are visual.  
Anyway you need to run the code to see the result.  
So there is no tests for the first lecture's code.  
Some other tasks in the course are visual also and don't have tests as well.

Sometimes files from different lectures are opened at the same time.  
Names of files starts from the number of the lecture, e.g. "L01".  
It's been made for the better navigate purpose.

Files with upload-suffix have been written to send it in the course-testing site.  
This files contains additional code below the main.  
This code is able to get some input data and give some output data (via print).  
Using a good editor (like the PyCharm), you can collapse a whole function in one line.  
It's much easier to read additional code this way.
