>Features:
- Tests for most of the answers.
- Every contest-answer has separated file with additional code for an upload purpose.
- Every answer has detailed description of the task (as a comment inside code).

>Some explanations:

Most of the answers is written as functions.  
You can put them in another file as modules.  
Tests use functions of answers as modules (via import).  
Tests is printing results when running.

Files with upload-suffix contains additional code.  
The code is able to get some input data and give some output data (via print).  
Using a good editor (like PyCharm), you can collapse a whole function in one line.  
It's much easier to read an additional code this way.

Some tasks are visual, e.g. tasks of 'Turtle' from Lecture 01.  
There is no written tests for it.  
Just run the files and look at the result.

Names of the files inside lectures-directories always starts from the number of a lecture.  
It has been made for a better navigate purpose.  
Becouse sometimes files from different lectures are opened at the same time.
