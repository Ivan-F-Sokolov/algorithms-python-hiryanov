You can find the playlist with all video-lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdZ4HF1SrFs&list=PLRDzFCPr95fK7tr47883DFUbm4GeOjjc0).  
Also the site with all tasks [here](http://judge.mipt.ru/mipt_cs_on_python3/).
***
>Features:
- If task is from contest, it has separated file with additional input-output code for an upload purpose.
- In each lecture folder, you will find a file with tests for every answer.
- Every answer has it's own full task description as a commentary inside the file.

>Some explanations:

Tasks is solved in function format. It can be used as modules in an another file.  
Tests imports task's functions as modules and tries it with different input data and the known result.  
Tests also prints a progress. Result from a task-file needs to be complied to the known result.  
In files with upload suffix, additional input-output code has written below an original file's functions.  
I suggest to use an editor (like PyCharm), where you can collapse function in a line.  
It's much easier to read an additional input-output code in files with upload suffix.
