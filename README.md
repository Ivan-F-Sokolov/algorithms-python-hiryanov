## **Description**

Timofey Hiryanov is a lecturer at the Moscow Institute of Physics and  
Technology. In 2017-2018, he held a course called: "**Algorithms and  
data structure in Python**". This study program is available for public  
access on YouTube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdZ4HF1SrFs&list=PLRDzFCPr95fK7tr47883DFUbm4GeOjjc0)). The lectures are also accompanied by tasks.  
The tasks are on a special website ([link](http://judge.mipt.ru/mipt_cs_on_python3/)). 737 and 738 groups are free  
for public access. This repository contains the answers for the tasks.  
_Materials of the course outside this repository are in russian language._

### **`Work in progress`**
I update the master branch with whole lectures. You can check other
